#summary Frequently asked questions.

*1. Why "_events/delegates_" and not "_signals/slots_"?*

First of all for personal historical reasons - first time when I met this mechanism was short experience of GUI programming with old and dirty VB6. But finally I've decided to use Microsoft's terminology instead of Trolltech's one in order to avoid name conflicts with existing implementations.

*2. Why was support for static functions disabled ?*

Usage of static functions as an event handlers is a symptom of a bad project design. In most cases (almost always) events handlers perform actions that require access to some state variables. In case of member functions, the {{{this}}} pointer is a legal way to supply function with access to state variables. In case of static functions state variables are accessed with use of global variables and non-stateless singletones. Both are considered to be dangerous and messy.
