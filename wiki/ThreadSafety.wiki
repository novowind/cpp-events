In order to port CppEvents to different threading API, the following should be done:
  # Create new directory for platform-specific files under 'Cpp/Events/' directory.
  # Modify file 'Cpp/Events/Config.hpp' and add preprocessor code for detecting your platform and setting {{{PLATFORM_DIR}}} macro to the name of directory for platform-specific files.
  # Implement {{{AtomicReferenceCounter}}} class in the file 'AtomicReferenceCounter.hpp.inl' using corresponding API for atomic operations.
  # Implement static functions of the {{{Threading}}} class in the file 'Threading.cpp.inl'
